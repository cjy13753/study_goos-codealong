# "Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests" code along

In order to better understand the book "Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests", I decided to code along on Intellij IDEA.
The book was already full of details about implementation, but I had trouble following along from time to time due to omission of certain details for brevity purpose.
Thankfully, I found [a github repository by skinny85](https://github.com/skinny85/goos-book-code) that made bridges here and there so people can follow the book with much ease.
My commit history is almost the same as that of the repository above though mine has some minor comments about some difficulty and differences I encountered in the commit body.
